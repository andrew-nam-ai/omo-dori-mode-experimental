# Lane done protocol

Give this file to every lane you launch.

When your lane's `Done =` signals are live (PR merged, issue closed, version published) and every change is pushed, claim done from your own session:

```sh
dori claim-done <your-lane-key> --evidence "<merge SHA, closed issue, version, links>"
```

The key is in your brief's lane footer. If you leave it out, the lane registered for your pane is used.

## What happens next

1. The Dori gets a `LANE_DONE_CLAIMED` event, and you get a `[LEAD]` line saying when the lane closes.
2. Stay idle and start no new work.
3. If the Dori does not object within 5 minutes, the watcher closes the lane. Before closing, it reads back every `Done =` signal live. It refuses to close if any of your worktrees still has uncommitted tracked changes, or commits that are on no remote.
4. Closing marks your thread done (when a thread hook is configured), closes your tab, and removes your worktrees.

## If the Dori objects, or a check fails

You get `[LEAD] not done: <reasons>; keep working, claim again when fixed` in your pane, and the lane goes back to not-done. This happens when:

- the Dori objects;
- a `Done =` signal does not read back live;
- there is unpushed work (the reason names the path).

Fix every reason, then claim again. A new claim starts a fresh 5-minute window.
